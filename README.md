## About the Repository  
This is a shared repository that contians all the files and code necessary to recreate the knitted html document seen from the pages display. The code is written in R using an r-markdown file, and it knitted to an html document.

## Problem Context
The first problem we address in this project looks at how total seed number differ between kangaroo rat mound locations in the Chihuahuan Desert grassland. The second problem works through determining how seed count varies with plot type, plant species, and total number of inflorescences. It then switches to if there is a simpler model that can explain seed count for different shrub species across Niwot Ridge.
